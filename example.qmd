Quarto extension for a template to generate a PDF with styling using LaTeX. 
You can find the underyling files here: https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/BioMathQuartoPDFTemplate

This is very much based on Nicola Rennie's [Making Pretty PDFs with Quarto](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/pdf-quarto/making-pretty-pdf-quarto/).

Here is a vector whose output would overflow if we had not changed the width in the underyling `_extension.yml`:

```{r}
letters
```

Here is some `inline code` and a code chunk:

```{r}
mod <- lm(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
anova(mod)
```
